```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## More Latex tricks

##Summation

$$\sum_{i=1}^S{n_i}=N$$

### Sentence texts

$$p(\mbox{Occurrence of species X})=0.67$$

### Escaping the backslash

$$\backslash a \le b \backslash$$

Rendering code of \LaTeX

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
library(ggplot2)
waterTemp <- runif(50)
planktonAbun <- runif(50)
qplot(x=waterTemp, y=planktonAbun)
# print(waterTemp)
# head(waterTemp)

```

Now we can add text here, say, anything we want, etc. because we no longer in R but in the world of `markdown`

```{r, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE}
qplot(x=waterTemp)
```
